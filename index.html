      <p>How can designers and front-end developers understand each other's work,
        comprehend what's similar and what's totally different, and later use that
        knowledge to get collaboration working like a well-oiled machine rather than
        pulling each other's hair off</p>

        Similar: Both profiles work on canvases. Both deal with color palettes, typography, etcetera. Both work with boxes.
        Different: Designers are free to work outside the box both figuratively and literally, they're able to draw free-hand shapes and make other elements adapt to it, while developers face what I call n-level limitation when implementing this sort of designs. Also, designers usually work on fixed containers while developers need to adapt designs to almost any size imaginable given the amount of device fragmentation around the world.

      <h1>HTML: official and up-to-date information</h1>

      <p>Do front-end developers know each and every single HTML tag? Absolutely NOT. Front-end development involves a fair amount of googling. HTML is vast and wide, attempting to remember each of its tags is useless.</p>

      <p>Although you will most likely find whatever you need on any site that references HTML, "official" channels are recommended:</p>

      <ul class="mt-30">
        <li>W3C HTML:<br> <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/">https://www.w3.org/html/</a></li>

      <p>Go to <a href="https://jsbin.com/">https://jsbin.com/</a> and place a heading of hierarchy 1 and a paragraph inside the <code>body</code> tag. Once you're done, don't close your browser tab.</p>

      <h1>HTML: GUI-based tools vs coding</h1>

      <p>Why coding when we already have apps and tools with graphical user interfaces to create websites?</p>

      <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> it depends on what you're looking for. GUI-based tools are great for speedy projects with low-level customization, while coding allows for granular control of assets, styles and interactions.</p>

      <img class="mt-30" src="images/gui-tools.gif" width="400">

      <aside class="notes">
        Some sites and apps do it great, like Webflow for example. Other offer a medium solution, like Squarespace. But what happens when a designer wants to add parallax scrolling with differents levels of speed? Or what happens when the designer would like to anchor content on scroll? What about scroll-based animations? Modals? Popovers? Most of these additions are either buggy or complicated to achieve on GUI-based tools, because HTML was never designed to be written with a GUI, it was the other way around.

      <h1>HTML: dynamic vs static website</h1>

      <p>What's the added workload to create dynamic websites rather than just editing an HTML document?</p>

      <p><strong>(Not so) short answer:</strong> static websites are pretty straight forward, write some code, check it out in a browser and watch the result, the caveat is that in order to update its content you'll have to do it manually by editing the HTML document. On the other side of the spectrum, dynamic websites add a layer of complexity that requires several extra steps with the advantage of being able to edit the site through some kind of interface.</p>

      <img class="mt-30" src="images/decisions.gif" width="400">

      <aside class="notes">
        For dynamic sites: does the webserver supports PHP or any other back-end language? Will some framework or CMS like WordPress be used? Is the environment secure? Is the front-end developer capable of wiring the site's HTML/CSS/JS into the back-end code of the site?
