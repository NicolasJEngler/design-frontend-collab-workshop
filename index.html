        Similar: Both profiles work on canvases. Both deal with color palettes, typography, etcetera. Both work with boxes.
        Different: Designers are free to work outside the box both figuratively and literally, they're able to draw free-hand shapes and make other elements adapt to it, while developers face what I call n-level limitation when implementing this sort of designs. Also, designers usually work on fixed containers while developers need to adapt designs to almost any size imaginable given the amount of device fragmentation around the world.

      <h1>HTML: GUI-based tools vs coding</h1>

      <p>Why coding when we already have apps and tools with graphical user interfaces to create websites?</p>

      <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> it depends on what you're looking for. GUI-based tools are great for speedy projects with low-level customization, while coding allows for granular control of assets, styles and interactions.</p>

      <img class="mt-30" src="images/gui-tools.gif" width="400">

      <aside class="notes">
        Some sites and apps do it great, like Webflow for example. Other offer a medium solution, like Squarespace. But what happens when a designer wants to add parallax scrolling with differents levels of speed? Or what happens when the designer would like to anchor content on scroll? What about scroll-based animations? Modals? Popovers? Most of these additions are either buggy or complicated to achieve on GUI-based tools, because HTML was never designed to be written with a GUI, it was the other way around.

      <h1>HTML: dynamic vs static website</h1>

      <p>What's the added workload to create dynamic websites rather than just editing an HTML document?</p>

      <p><strong>(Not so) short answer:</strong> static websites are pretty straight forward, write some code, check it out in a browser and watch the result, the caveat is that in order to update its content you'll have to do it manually by editing the HTML document. On the other side of the spectrum, dynamic websites add a layer of complexity that requires several extra steps with the advantage of being able to edit the site through some kind of interface.</p>

      <img class="mt-30" src="images/decisions.gif" width="400">

      <aside class="notes">
        For dynamic sites: does the webserver supports PHP or any other back-end language? Will some framework or CMS like WordPress be used? Is the environment secure? Is the front-end developer capable of wiring the site's HTML/CSS/JS into the back-end code of the site?

      <h1>CSS: The box model</h1>

      <p>CSS has a box model in order to organize different properties when styling an element, i.e.: margin, border and padding. This help us understand, for example, where background will be clipped, or where there'll be spacing in between elements when using margins.</p>

      <h1>CSS: unstyled vs styled</h1>

      <p>CSS basically allows us to style whatever we want in a page, give it a determined size, background color, drop shadow, border, rounded corners, flow, etcetera. HTML alone looks pretty straight forward: a basic document with little to no style that flows from top to bottom, while HTML + CSS allow us to turn that into something more unique.</p>

      <h1>CSS: n-level limitations</h1>

      <p>N-level limitations are basically features of a design that turn into caveats whenever translating those to front-end development.</p>

      <img src="images/shapes-example.png" width="480">

      <small><strong>Note:</strong> Image found in Tubik's studio "Psychology of shapes" post <a href="https://tubikstudio.com/knock-design-into-shape-psychology-of-shapes/">https://tubikstudio.com/knock-design-into-shape-psychology-of-shapes/</a></small>
      
      <aside class="notes">
        The most basic examples are freehand or complex shapes, given that translating those to a box model is difficult. The 1st-level limitation we find here is creating that same shape in HTML: do we use an SVG as a background? Do we use the <code>clip-path</code> property and leave older browsers with a square? And after that is solved, we encounter a 2nd-level limitation which is how do we follow the flow of that shape? This are the sort of caveats that we, as a team, need to think beforhand in order to tackle those head on without compromising each other's work.

      <p>Each library has its own purpose and thus its own level of complexity. The libraries that usually interest the most to designers are the ones that give the capability to create visually appealing experiences. A library that allows shape morphing or meshing might be a bit more complex than a library used to add tabulation capabilities like filtering and/or column toggling.</p>
