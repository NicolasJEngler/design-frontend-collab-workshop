# Design + front-end: collaboration without compromising
## This is the repository of my workshop on collaboration between team members, designers, and front-end developers

This presentation is based on `reveal.js`. Check out their [repo](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) if you need to know anything other than the basic setup.

In this workshop we're going to go through the advantages and caveats of implementing UI/UX designs on the front-end side of things while respecting the creative proposals and direction of designers.
